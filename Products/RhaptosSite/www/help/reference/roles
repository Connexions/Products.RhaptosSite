There are three primary roles that a person may take when contributing
to the system: Author, Maintainer, and Copyright Holder.
The usual case is that the same person or people will fill all three
roles for a given module or course, but that is not required.  You may
take any combination of roles on a given module or course, and an
entirely different set on another work.


Author -- Users listed as authors receive credit for writing the
          material.  The author is the one who is responsible for the
          creation of the work, but may or may not be the one who
          actually enters work.
       
Maintainer -- Users listed as maintainers have permission to submit
	      successive versions of a module or course.  We expect
	      that most authors will also serve as maintainers for
	      their materials, but some may choose not to.  Authors
	      may also wish to appoint additional maintainers to
	      assist them in updating the materials. 
 
Copyright Holder -- Users listed as copyright holders have the legal
		    right to license the materials.  In most cases,
		    the copyright holder is the same person as the
		    author, but this may not be the case in some
		    institutions where faculty and employees are
		    required to sign over copyright to the
		    institution.  In this case the institution serves
		    as copyright holder and the individual retains the
		    author and/or maintainer roles.
