  - lwb-hot-fixes (03 Dec 2009)

RhaptosSite-1.28
  - light-weight-branding (30 Oct 2009)
    - Created accounts management page
    - Added search and search results to accounts management page
    - Fixing issues with padding in Rhaptos look and font-size in both
      looks. Removing styling for #cnx_branding_logo in ploneCustom.css
      files because that <div> shouldn't show up on the lens listing
      page. Remove branding header from ploneCustom.css files because I
      don't have such headers for anything else in those files (and don't
      want to imply that everything under them is related to branding).
    - change_account_branding script needed for its parameters to have defaults.
    - empty search return sets were causing mischief.

    - added property for "tech support" email address for queue notifications

    provide for a negative return from 'lookup'. Fix #8488.

RhaptosSite-1.20
  - cnxml-0.6 (30 Jan 2009)
    - bare ampersand causing fits, apparently, for JS. Use entity, correctly, instead
    - Close input tag, to be more correct. This is valid HTML, but not XHTML
    - Remove special module case of schema selection (really just MathML choice). The 
      duties of module_set_schema.cpy have moved into manage_afterAdd, so index.cnxml 
      is now created as soon as the module object is.
    - Modified all references to unibrowser to cnxml_render. 
    - Fixed lack of a space in "Warning:Your changes..."
    - Makes the use of content_title as landing page on new content explicit, instead of 
      relying on the redirect in getContentOverridePage (which no longer performs the redirect
       for modules).
    - Add the 3.0 version of the attribution license to the list of licenses, and make it the 
      default. This fixes several places where version 2.0, or a choice between 1.0 and 2.0, was 
      hardcoded. getDefaultLicense.py is still not in a license tool like it should be, but it's 
      moved from RMS to RhaptosContent, and there's now a getLicenseData method both on content and 
      on the ModuleDBTool that pulls license data from the postgres database.
    - Added 3.0 license to list

RhaptosSite-1.19.3
  - fix API problem with checking for site_license, which caused it to be always false
    (portal_url is a string, not the portal object). Follows a cnx.org hotfix.

  - Removed now unnecessary forced white-space behavior in collaborations.pt (max)
