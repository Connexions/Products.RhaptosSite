Workgroups are a scratch area -- 
  They are a convenient place to put modules and other files you
  or your colleagues are working on.

Workgroups are private -- 
  The only people who can see the contents of a workgroup are its
  members.  This way you and your collaborators can work on material
  together to get it "just right" before publishing it in the
  repository.

Workgroups are not related to "contributor roles":roles --
  Just because someone is in a workgroup does not give them the
  automatic ability to publish a new module; it merely means they can
  see it while in development.

Workgroups have no social hierarchy -- 
  Any member may add or remove members or content. The creator of the
  group has no special privileges.

Workgroups have no formal requests for joining (yet) --
  To join a group, you must have a current member of the group add you
  as a member.  It is assumed that, for the time being, all
  collaborators have other means of communication with each other and
  can form groups by common consent.

Workgroups disappear after everyone leaves --
  If you are the last to leave a group, you will be asked to confirm
  the decision to delete the group. If you accept, the group will be
  deleted and any content in the group *will be deleted*.
